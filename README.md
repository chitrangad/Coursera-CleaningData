# Coursera-CleaningData
## Repo for final project for the course. The repo has 3 files: readme.md, codebook.md, run_analysis.R

Following is accomplished in this project:

* Download the zip file containing data
* Create datasets with the activity and feature files
* Read training and test datasets.
* Use only mean or standard deviation labels
* Combine both test and training datasets along with activity and features data
* Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
* Finally, generate tidy dataset with only average values of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
* tidy.txt file is the extract created from dataset in above step.
